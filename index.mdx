## Who it is for

<Note>
  BETTER is launching in stages. The Terminal (with live copy trading) goes live within 48 hours of the token generation event (21 January 2026).
</Note>

- **Vault depositors** who want passive exposure to prediction-market alpha
- **Active traders** who want real-time signals and execution context in the Terminal
- **Builders/integrators** who need telemetry, strategy feeds, or on-chain indexing

## Core capabilities

- **Rust-based high-frequency trading execution** with in-region and co-located routing
- **AI agent pipeline** (BRAID protocol) that processes on-chain signals at scale
- **Vault-based access** on Base with optional receipt tokenization (`vBETTER`)
- **Terminal** for real-time feeds, performance, and copy-trading

## Architecture at a glance

| Component            | What it does                                                          |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Vaults**           | Aggregate USD Coin deposits on Base and execute strategies on your behalf |
| **Execution Engine** | Low-latency Rust stack co-located with prediction market order books  |
| **AI Agents**        | Generate signals using the BRAID protocol and a Reasoning DAG         |
| **Terminal**         | Surfaces live feeds, signal context, and copy-trading tools           |
