## Executive summary

Crypto is undergoing its most significant structural rotation since the decentralised finance cycle of 2020. For the past half-decade, retail capital has concentrated in leveraged perpetual futures. That era rewarded leverage, liquidation mechanics, and microstructure games.

Capital is migrating toward prediction markets where settlement is anchored to verifiable outcomes. The venue changes, but the structural disadvantage persists. Settlement can be fair while trading remains unequal.

The advantage shifts from liquidation engines to latency.

On-chain analysis indicates that approximately **89 per cent** of retail participants on Polymarket realise net losses. The primary reason is not settlement. It is alpha decay.

BETTER is a liquidity abstraction layer that packages institutional-grade execution into a retail-accessible system:

- **Terminal:** real-time signal feed, execution context, and copy-trading tooling.
- **Vaults:** pooled USD Coin on Base that executes strategies on behalf of depositors.
- **Execution rails:** Rust-first, in-region and co-located routing.
- **OpenServ agents (BRAID):** bounded reasoning DAGs and machine-checkable decision records.

### Key quantitative claims (internal telemetry)

- More than **10 million** signals collected in approximately **five months**.
- **10,000 to 40,000** elite-wallet trade setups per day.
- Approximately **0.6 milliseconds** tick-to-trade, measured from mempool read to transaction hash on Base, then to order finality on Polymarket (Polygon).
- The system filters approximately **40,000** distinct on-chain signals per day.

These figures vary with market conditions, venue availability, and network performance.

<Note>
  Earlier drafts of this thesis referenced a December 18 and January 8 token generation event and an access gate of 1,500 tokens. The current live parameters are documented in this repository, including a 21 January 2026 token generation event and a fully diluted valuation ratchet gate. The older figures remain included here as historical references.

## Part I: The erosion of trust and the failure of the perpetual casino

### 1.1 The illusion of price action

Perpetual futures promise price action. Retail traders believe chart reading, support and resistance, and macro narratives are sufficient to profit. In practice, they trade inside a venue optimised for professional liquidity providers.

### 1.2 The mechanics of liquidity pulling

The dominant extraction pattern is liquidity pulling. In this pattern, professional participants target the weighted average liquidation price of a leveraged cohort.

The process operates in four phases:

1. **The bait (accumulation):** price drifts into a technical buy zone. Retail enters with leverage, typically **10x to 50x**.
2. **The trap (identification):** algorithms estimate the cohort liquidation band.
3. **The pull (withdrawal):** buy-side liquidity is removed in a synchronised event.
4. **The harvest (the wick):** price snaps into liquidation levels, triggering stops and forced liquidations, then mean reverts.

One observed proxy for this behaviour is the frequency of price wicks greater than **3 per cent** within **1-minute** candles coinciding with liquidation volume.

### 1.3 The regulatory smoking gun

In late 2024, United States law enforcement ran a public operation using a decoy token (NexFundAI) to test whether market participants would offer manipulation services. The result validated that market manipulation can be offered as a service.

### 1.4 Casino fatigue

Over time, participants experience casino fatigue. They become less willing to accept microstructure outcomes that feel disconnected from fundamentals. This creates demand for markets that settle on facts.

---

## Part II: The migration to truth and the rise of prediction markets

### 2.1 Binary settlement

A prediction market contract pays **US\$1.00** if an event resolves YES and **US\$0.00** otherwise. Settlement is enforced by an oracle resolution system.

Unlike perpetual futures, a market maker cannot wick a real-world outcome.

### 2.2 The hard floor of value

If a trader holds a winning share to maturity, the payout is mathematically fixed at **US\$1.00**. This creates a hard floor of value that does not exist in floating-index derivatives.

### 2.3 The brutal reality check

Despite fair settlement, retail traders still lose. Approximately **89 per cent** of retail participants on Polymarket realise net losses.

The explanation is the gap between settlement fairness and microstructure fairness.

---

## Part III: The physics of alpha decay

### 3.1 Alpha is a melting ice cube

In prediction markets, alpha is a short-lived pricing error created by information asymmetry. In the digital age, information propagates quickly. Alpha decay is measured in milliseconds.

### 3.2 The timeline of a trade: human versus machine

Scenario: a breaking-news message confirms that an outcome has become far more likely.

1. **The event (T = 0.000s):** information is published.
2. **Machine reaction (T = 0.010s):** automated systems ingest the event, compute the new probability, and place orders.
3. **Price discovery (T = 0.100s):** the order book reprices and the alpha window collapses.
4. **Human reaction (T = 30.000s):** the retail trader receives a notification.
5. **Retail execution (T = 45.000s):** the retail trader opens the venue and buys at the post-reprice level.

The retail trader buys stale odds. The machine sells into that demand.

### 3.3 Co-location and execution priority

The gap is not a skill gap. It is physics. Professional execution uses:

- co-located or in-region routing
- direct smart contract interaction and sequencer-aware submission
- priority mechanisms, including MEV-style ordering, where applicable

### 3.4 The fallacy of manual copy trading

Manual copy trading degrades under slippage.

Example:

1. Master trader buys at **US\$0.40**.
2. Copy system reacts **2 to 5 seconds** later.
3. Copier buys at **US\$0.45**.
4. Both sell at **US\$0.50**.

Profit comparison:

- Master: **US\$0.10** per share, **25 per cent**.
- Copier: **US\$0.05** per share, **11 per cent**.

Fees and gas consume the degraded edge.

### 3.5 Behavioural taxes

Retail participants also pay behavioural taxes:

- **Long-shot bias:** buying contracts priced at **1 cent** or **2 cents** hoping for **100x**, overweighting small probabilities (treating **1 per cent** like **5 per cent**).
- **Wishcasting:** betting on desired outcomes rather than evidence.
- **Duration mismanagement:** holding to maturity and absorbing tail risk and lock-up opportunity cost.

---

## Part IV: The elite tier

If the majority loses, a minority captures the alpha window. On-chain behaviour clusters into three archetypes.

### 4.1 Information-driven flow

Case study: the 2024 Nobel Peace Prize market.

- A wallet identified as 6741 placed a **US\$50,000** position approximately **nine hours** before the official announcement.
- The implied probability shifted from **3 per cent** to **70 per cent** shortly after.

The BETTER approach does not rely on possessing inside information. It detects the footprint of informed flow and replicates it within the same latency regime.

### 4.2 Endgame sweeping

When an outcome becomes near-certain, contracts often trade at a discount (for example **US\$0.96** or **US\$0.97**) due to temporary liquidity gaps. Automated systems sweep available shares and redeem at **US\$1.00**, capturing an approximately **4 per cent** return over minutes.

### 4.3 Cross-venue probability alignment

Sports and macro markets exhibit an odds-consensus across external venues. A simple alignment trade exists when one venue implies **66 per cent** and the prediction market trades at **US\$0.60**.

---

## Part V: BETTER, a structural solution to the inequality of speed

### 5.1 What BETTER is

BETTER is not a signal group. It is not a chat room. It is a liquidity abstraction layer between user capital and prediction market execution.

The thesis is simple: the alpha window is not accessible manually. Execution must be machine-mediated.

### 5.2 Technology: OpenServ agents and BRAID

BETTER uses OpenServ agents running BRAID (Bounded Reasoning for Autonomous Inference and Decisions). Each trade is gated by a machine-checkable reasoning DAG.

Example gate:

1. Ingest: wallet trigger detected with an Insider Score.
2. Liquidity gate: can the trade enter without more than **2 per cent** slippage?
3. Risk gate: does correlation exceed **0.8** with existing exposure?
4. Execute: submit via deterministic execution paths.

If the logic does not hold, the trade does not execute.

### 5.3 Infrastructure: speed as the product

The Terminal targets approximately **0.6 milliseconds** tick-to-trade, defined as mempool read to transaction hash on Base, then to order finality on Polymarket (Polygon).

### 5.4 Filtering engine: separating signal from noise

Speed without curation is a fast way to lose money. BETTER filters approximately **40,000** daily signals and maintains a rotating pool of elite directional wallets.

The Z-score engine weights features beyond simple profit and loss:

| Metric | Why it matters |
| --- | --- |
| Sharpe ratio | Risk-adjusted return; high volatility is penalised |
| Sortino ratio | Downside-aware risk-adjusted return |
| Win rate | Consistency across large samples |
| Profit per trade | Scalping versus trend capture |
| Wallet age and interaction patterns | Informed-flow detection and burner suppression |

### 5.5 Vault abstraction

The Vault product packages this stack into one action: deposit USD Coin on Base, meet the `$BETTER` access gate, and allow the engine to rotate across qualified opportunities.

---

## Part VI: Deterministic trading engine specification (current implementation)

The engine is split into two deterministic routes:

- **FAST15M:** Rust-only for short-horizon up and down markets.
- **LONG:** bounded inference via BRAID workflows and multi-LLM consensus, with deterministic execution and sizing.

Inference is advisory and bounded. Execution is deterministic and authoritative.

### 6.1 Contract model and notation

A binary contract pays **US\$1.00** if an event resolves YES and **US\$0.00** otherwise.

- Let \(\pi\in(0,1)\) be the displayed executable ask price for YES.
- Let \(p\in(0,1)\) be the engine's subjective probability of YES.
- Let \(B\) be the bankroll allocated to the engine.
- Deployed notional is \(x\in[0,B]\), with fraction \(f=x/B\).

### 6.2 Core invariant: bounded inference, deterministic execution

The inference layer can reason freely, but it may only emit a bounded record with strict types. The deterministic core recomputes all numeric quantities and refuses any action that violates invariants.

Malformed inference outputs are treated as abstentions.

### 6.3 Routing and persistent state

Markets route deterministically:

`Route(k) ∈ { FAST15M, LONG }`

Per-market state tracks book snapshots, spreads, depth proxies, time-to-expiry, wallet caches, inference bookkeeping, and current exposure.

### 6.4 Deterministic admissibility predicate

Admissibility is evaluated before any inference call, sizing, or order placement:

`Adm(k,t) = 1{Δt ≤ Tmax(Route(k))} · 1{SpreadBps ≤ Smax(Route(k))} · 1{Depth ≥ Dmin(Route(k))}`

### 6.5 Wallet behaviour filter

Wallets are filtered deterministically to suppress non-directional flow.

A wallet is flagged two-sided if it trades both outcomes inside a short window. Only directional wallets contribute to triggers.

### 6.6 Costs, effective price, and net edge discipline

All decisions use effective prices including conservative costs:

`πeff = πask + cfee + cslip(k,t)`

Net edge for buying YES is `eYES = p − πeff`. Trades require `e ≥ τmin(Route(k))`.

### 6.7 Kelly sizing with conservative multipliers and hard caps

For a YES buy, the cost-adjusted Kelly fraction is:

`f* = max(0, (p − πeff) / (1 − πeff))`

Deployed fraction uses fractional Kelly and caps:

`fdeploy = λ · min(f*, fmax)`

Notional is `x = B · fdeploy`, then clipped by per-trade, per-market, and portfolio caps. No inference output can bypass caps.

---

### 6.8 FAST15M engine

FAST15M markets are handled exclusively by Rust logic.

#### Probability anchor

The engine computes a conservative driftless probability anchor (with uncertainty inflation):

`pup(t) = 1 − Φ( log(Sref/St) / (η·bσ·sqrt(Δt)) )`, with `η ≥ 1`.

#### Permission and sizing

Trades require admissibility and edge.

Sizing uses ultra-small fractional Kelly and a deterministic jump-risk haircut `J ∈ (0,1)`:

`fdeploy = λ15m · J · min(f*, f15m_max)`

#### Execution state machine

Orders follow a deterministic state machine:

- **Join:** maker posting under stable depth and sufficient time.
- **Chase:** bounded cancel-repost with deterministic cooldown.
- **Cross:** taker execution only when edge exceeds a stricter threshold and time-to-expiry is small.
- **Abort:** do nothing, log reason.

Client order ids are deterministic and idempotent.

---

### 6.9 LONG engine: BRAID graphs and multi-LLM consensus

LONG markets call bounded inference under strict throttles and budgets.

#### Bounded decision record

Each model emits a strict record. Narrative content is ignored.

Example record fields:

```text
ACTION=BUY|SELL|HOLD
OUTCOME=YES|NO
P_TRUE=0.xx
UNCERTAINTY=LOW|MED|HIGH
SIZE_MULT=0.xx
FLAGS=...
RATIONALE_HASH=...
```

Malformed records are treated as abstentions.

#### Consensus gate

A trade is permitted only with **3-of-4** consensus on direction.

#### Aggregation and dispersion penalty

The deterministic core aggregates probabilities using calibration weights, then applies a dispersion penalty that reduces deployed risk when agreeing models disagree.

#### Debouncing and budgeting

Inference is per-market debounced with deterministic triggers. A strict global budget is enforced. Budget exhaustion yields abstention rather than weakened constraints.

---

### 6.10 Exit and de-risking

As prices approach extremes, remaining upside is small while dispute risk, ambiguity, and capital lock-up dominate.

The engine implements deterministic scale-out bands. One reference schedule uses bands at **0.90** and **0.95**.

This is designed to manage the common path where an entry near **0.40** compresses toward **0.95**.

---

### 6.11 Storage, audit, and monitoring

Hot-path trading uses compact storage (no large JSON parsing). Every decision and fill is logged for replay.

Monitoring includes realised versus assumed slippage, fill rates, abstention reasons, edge distributions, calibration curves, and exposure concentration.

---

## Part VII: In-house open-source LLM and OpenRouter API credits

BETTER trains an in-house, open-source LLM exclusively on prediction market data and makes it available via OpenRouter.

Access is sold as API credits through OpenRouter. This is distinct from BETTER application telemetry endpoints.

---

## Part VIII: Token economics and alignment

### Token summary

- Token: `$BETTER`
- Network: Base
- Total supply: 1,000,000,000
- Initial liquidity: Base BETTER/ETH pool (liquidity provider tokens locked)

### Allocation and vesting

| Allocation | Per cent | Amount | Vesting and lock-up |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Public sale (launchpad) | 25% | 250,000,000 | Unlocked at the token generation event |
| Liquidity (Base BETTER/ETH) | 15% | 150,000,000 | Locked permanently (liquidity provider tokens locked) |
| Team | 20% | 200,000,000 | 15-month vesting with a 6-month cliff, then 9-month linear unlock |
| Treasury | 25% | 250,000,000 | 12-month linear unlock from the token generation event |
| OpenServ SERV token drop | 5% | 50,000,000 | Unlocked (claimed by SERV token stakers via tasks) |
| Programmatic funding | 10% | 100,000,000 | Released across fully diluted valuation bands |

Initial circulating supply is defined as the public sale allocation plus the liquidity allocation: approximately 400,000,000 tokens (40 per cent).

### Access gating

Hold `$BETTER` to view the Terminal. Stake the same quantity to deposit into Vaults.

The current access gate ratchets by fully diluted valuation. See [Tokenomics](/token/tokenomics) for phase thresholds, worked examples, and Lite Mode behaviour.

### Fees

- Vault performance fee: 20 per cent on profits only, charged on withdrawal.
- Lite Mode: 2 per cent of notional volume (in USD Coin terms) traded via the Terminal.
