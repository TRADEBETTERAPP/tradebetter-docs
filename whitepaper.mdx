# The End of the Casino. The Beginning of the Truth.

<Note>
  This whitepaper summarises the market rotation towards prediction markets, the physics of latency ("alpha decay"), and how BETTER packages institutional-grade execution into a retail-accessible Terminal and Vault system.

## Executive summary

For the past half-decade, a large portion of retail crypto trading activity has concentrated in leveraged perpetual futures. As capital migrates into prediction markets, settlement becomes more objective, but trading remains structurally unequal.

The primary structural advantage shifts from liquidation mechanics to latency.

BETTER is a liquidity abstraction layer that combines signal discovery, bounded decision-making, and low-latency execution into a retail-accessible system for prediction markets:

- **Terminal:** real-time signal feed with execution context and copy-trading.
- **Vaults:** pooled USD Coin on Base that executes strategies on behalf of depositors.
- **Execution rails:** Rust-first, co-located and in-region routing.
- **OpenServ agents (BRAID):** bounded decision graphs that apply verifiable constraints before any trade.

BETTER is raising **US$500,000** via a simple agreement for future equity to bring the Terminal, co-located routing, and initial Vault releases to production.

### Key operating claims (from internal telemetry)

- **Signals:** more than **10 million** signals collected in approximately **five months**.
- **Daily setups:** **10,000–40,000** elite-wallet trade setups per day.
- **Latency (public claim):** approximately **0.6 milliseconds** tick-to-trade, measured from mempool read to transaction hash on Base, then to order finality on Polymarket (Polygon).

These figures reflect internal telemetry and may vary with market conditions, venue availability, and network performance.

## Part I — The end of the casino

### Why leveraged crypto markets feel adversarial

Perpetual futures enable leverage and continuous trading, but they also amplify structural disadvantages for manual traders:

- forced liquidation dynamics
- thin order-book moments and abrupt price dislocations
- asymmetric access to low-latency infrastructure and order-flow data

Over time, this produces “casino fatigue”: users increasingly seek markets where settlement is anchored to verifiable outcomes.

---

## Part II — The beginning of the truth

Prediction markets settle contracts based on real-world facts. Unlike floating-index derivatives, contracts settle to a fixed value (for example: US$1.00 for YES, US$0.00 for NO) once an oracle resolves the outcome.

This removes a set of manipulation vectors present in leveraged derivatives, but it does not make execution fair.

Settlement can be objective while microstructure remains competitive.

## Part III — The physics of alpha decay

### Alpha decays in milliseconds

In prediction markets, edge is time-sensitive. When credible new information arrives (news, order flow shifts, on-chain activity), prices update rapidly. The time between signal and reprice is the “alpha window”, and it is measured in milliseconds.

### Human versus machine execution (illustrative)

1. Information is published (T = 0).
2. Automated systems ingest and execute within milliseconds.
3. The order book reprices.
4. Humans receive notifications, open an application, and submit orders later.

The consequence is predictable: manual trading often buys stale odds, while automated traders capture the move.

### Why manual copy trading degrades

Copy trading that follows observed trades introduces structural drag:

- slippage from chasing moved prices
- adverse selection when fast traders exit into slower followers
- fees that consume already-thin edges

---

## Part IV — Who wins in prediction markets

Consistently profitable behaviour tends to fall into a small number of categories:

1. **Speed-first execution:** reacting quickly to new information and order-flow shifts.
2. **Endgame sweeping:** buying contracts that are near-certain but still discounted due to temporary liquidity gaps.
3. **Cross-venue probability arbitrage:** aligning odds with other liquid markets (sportsbooks, exchanges, or structured information feeds).

BETTER is designed to package these behaviours into a single system, with bounded constraints and risk controls.

## Part V — BETTER: democratising speed

### Product primitives

#### Terminal (active)

The Terminal surfaces real-time signal context:

- elite-wallet setups and historical accuracy scoring
- liquidity depth and slippage estimates
- correlation context and risk limits

Terminal access is gated by holding `$BETTER`.

#### Vaults (passive)

Vaults pool USD Coin on Base and execute strategies on behalf of depositors:

- deposit USD Coin
- BETTER executes qualified strategies
- performance fees apply only on realised profit, charged on withdrawal

Vault access is gated by staking `$BETTER` (the same quantity required to view the Terminal).

### Architecture (conceptual)

1. **Ingest:** on-chain activity, order-book data, and external feeds.
2. **Score:** rank wallets and events using statistical and historical features.
3. **Decide (BRAID):** build a reasoning DAG and apply explicit constraints (liquidity, slippage, correlation, and risk limits).
4. **Execute:** a Rust execution engine submits transactions with low-latency routing.
5. **Account:** optional receipt tokens can represent vault performance.

### What is BRAID?

BRAID (Bounded Reasoning for Autonomous Inference and Decisions) is BETTER’s constrained decision framework.

It emphasises explicit constraints over free-form automation:

- auditable decision records
- abort conditions when liquidity or risk thresholds are breached
- deterministic execution paths

## Part VI — Token economics and alignment

### Token summary

- **Token:** `$BETTER`
- **Network:** Base
- **Total supply:** 1,000,000,000
- **Initial liquidity:** Base **BETTER/ETH** pool (liquidity provider tokens locked)

### Allocation (summary)

| Allocation | Per cent | Amount | Notes |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Public sale (launchpad) | 25% | 250,000,000 | Unlocked at the token generation event |
| Liquidity (Base BETTER/ETH) | 15% | 150,000,000 | Locked permanently (liquidity provider tokens locked) |
| Team | 20% | 200,000,000 | Zero per cent at the token generation event; six-month cliff then nine-month linear release |
| Treasury | 25% | 250,000,000 | Unlocked at the token generation event |
| OpenServ SERV token drop | 5% | 50,000,000 | Unlocked (claimed by SERV token stakers via tasks) |
| Programmatic funding | 10% | 100,000,000 | Released across fully diluted valuation bands |

Initial circulating supply is defined as the public sale allocation plus the liquidity allocation: approximately 400,000,000 tokens (40 per cent).

### Access gating (ratchet)

Access thresholds decrease as fully diluted valuation rises, targeting a comparatively stable USD access cost while limiting congestion.

Hold `$BETTER` to view the Terminal; stake the same quantity to deposit into Vaults.

See [Tokenomics](/token/tokenomics) for phase thresholds, worked examples, and Lite Mode behaviour.

### Vault fees

- **Performance fee:** twenty per cent on profits only.
- **Timing:** charged on withdrawal.
- **No fee on losses:** no fee if USD Coin withdrawn is below entry value (based on average entry per wallet).

### Lite Mode (Terminal)

Lite Mode is an optional execution path enabled at log-in:

- halves the Terminal holding requirement
- Vault staking requirements remain unchanged
- charges two per cent of notional volume (in USD Coin terms) on trades executed via the Terminal in Lite Mode
