# BETTER Whitepaper

<Note>
  This document is written for venture capitalists and early-stage investors evaluating BETTER. It is intended to be read quickly at first pass, then revisited during diligence.
</Note>

## Reading guide

## Executive summary

BETTER is building execution infrastructure for prediction markets that allows retail traders to access professional-grade speed and tooling.

In prediction markets, edge decays quickly: when news breaks, prices move in milliseconds. People trading manually often arrive after the move; algorithmic systems arrive first.

BETTER’s approach is to make speed available to retail traders through:

1. **A Terminal** that surfaces elite-wallet trade setups, provides context, and enables copy trading.
2. **Vaults** that pool USD Coin on Base and execute strategies on behalf of depositors.
3. **A high-frequency trading execution stack** designed for in-region and co-located routing at Terminal launch.
4. **Bounded, auditable automated decision-making** via the Bounded Reasoning for Autonomous Inference and Decisions protocol.

BETTER is raising 500,000 via a simple agreement for future equity to bring the Terminal, co-located execution, and initial Vault releases to production.

## The problem

Prediction markets settle on objective outcomes, but execution is not fair.

When the first credible signals emerge (on-chain wallet activity, order flow shifts, and liquidity dislocations), the market reprices rapidly. Retail traders are structurally disadvantaged:

- They see the information later.
- They react slower.
- They face worse prices and worse fills.

The result is that prediction markets can feel like a casino: sophisticated systems harvest speed-based edge while manual participants become the liquidity.

---

## The BETTER solution

BETTER exists to democratise speed in prediction markets.

Instead of competing against high-speed systems, retail users can opt into a shared execution layer:

### The Terminal

The Terminal is the active interface:

- Elite-wallet signal feed with context
- Real-time execution stream
- Copy trading within the Terminal

Terminal access is gated by holding `$BETTER`.

### Vaults

Vaults are the passive interface:

- Users deposit USD Coin on Base
- Automated strategies execute on behalf of depositors
- A performance fee is charged on profits only, on withdrawal

Vault access is gated by staking `$BETTER` (the same quantity required to view the Terminal).

### Execution infrastructure

BETTER’s execution stack is built for low latency, determinism, and reliability.

Public tick-to-trade claim:

- Approximately 0.6 milliseconds, measured from mempool read to transaction hash on Base, then to order finality on Polymarket (Polygon).

For Terminal launch, production routing is designed to be co-located in the same data centre facility as the relevant prediction market order books.

---

## Traction

BETTER has already demonstrated sustained signal collection and real-time processing at scale.

Traction highlights:

- More than ten million signals collected in approximately five months.
- 10,000–40,000 elite-wallet trade setups per day.
- Approximately 0.6 milliseconds tick-to-trade (definition above).

---

## Market context

Prediction markets are converging with multiple large markets:

- Gambling and sports betting
- Financial derivatives
- News and information distribution

As prediction markets mature, execution speed becomes a core differentiator, similar to equities and foreign exchange markets.

---

## Product detail

### Signals and decision-making

BETTER ingests market data and on-chain activity, then produces trade setups with confidence.

The decision engine uses bounded reasoning: signals are only promoted to execution when constraints are satisfied (liquidity, risk correlation, and admissibility rules).

### Copy trading

The Terminal enables users to act on signals without building their own infrastructure.

Copy trading is part of the initial Terminal release and is planned to go live within 48 hours of the token generation event (21 January 2026).

### Receipt tokens

BETTER plans a receipt token (`vBETTER`) that represents a share of vault performance. Receipt tokens aim to make vault exposure transferable and tradable.

---

## Business model

BETTER is designed with multiple revenue lines:

### Performance fee (Vaults)

- Twenty per cent performance fee on profits only.
- Charged on withdrawal.
- No fee if USD Coin withdrawn is below entry value (based on average entry per wallet).

### Lite Mode fee (Terminal)

Lite Mode is an optional execution path enabled at log-in.

- When enabled, the Terminal holding requirement halves.
- Vault access requirements remain unchanged across fully diluted valuation tiers.
- A fee of two per cent of notional volume (in USD Coin terms) is charged on volume traded via the Terminal.

### Business-to-business product

BETTER plans to sell its Rust data ingestion stack to quantitative funds and bucket shops seeking prediction market exposure.

### Model training and credits

After the token generation event, BETTER plans to train an in-house open-source model tuned on BETTER signals and sell application programming interface credits.

## Token economics and access gating

### Supply and allocations

- Total supply: 1,000,000,000 `$BETTER` on Base.

Allocation:

| Allocation | Per cent | Amount | Notes |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Public sale (launchpad) | 25% | 250,000,000 | Unlocked at the token generation event |
| Liquidity (Base and USD Coin) | 15% | 150,000,000 | Locked permanently (liquidity provider tokens locked) |
| Team | 20% | 200,000,000 | Zero per cent at the token generation event; six-month cliff then nine-month linear release |
| Treasury | 25% | 250,000,000 | Unlocked at the token generation event |
| OpenServ SERV token drop | 5% | 50,000,000 | Unlocked (claimed by SERV token stakers via tasks) |
| Programmatic funding | 10% | 100,000,000 | Released across fully diluted valuation bands |

Initial circulating supply is defined as the public sale allocation plus the liquidity allocation: approximately 400,000,000 tokens (40 per cent).

### Hold and stake semantics

- Hold `$BETTER` to view the Terminal.
- Stake the same quantity to deposit into Vaults.

Staked `$BETTER` remains locked until a user withdraws all funds from the vault.

### Fully diluted valuation gate phases

| Phase | Fully diluted valuation | Terminal (hold) | Vaults (stake) |
| ---: | --- | ---: | ---: |
| One | Below $10 million | 100,000 | 100,000 |
| Two | $10 million–$20 million | 75,000 | 75,000 |
| Three | $20 million–$40 million | 50,000 | 50,000 |
| Four | $100 million or more | 10,000 | 10,000 |

Examples:

- At $0.005 ($5 million market capitalisation): approximately $500 (Phase one)
- At $0.01 ($10 million market capitalisation): approximately $1,000 (Phase one)
- At $0.02 ($20 million market capitalisation): approximately $1,500 (Phase two)
- At $0.04 ($40 million market capitalisation): approximately $2,000 (Phase three)
- At $0.10 ($100 million market capitalisation): approximately $1,000 (Phase four)

### Lite Mode thresholds

| Phase | Terminal (hold) | Terminal (hold) with Lite Mode |
| ---: | ---: | ---: |
| One | 100,000 | 50,000 |
| Two | 75,000 | 37,500 |
| Three | 50,000 | 25,000 |
| Four | 10,000 | 5,000 |

## Competitive moat

BETTER’s moat is a combination of infrastructure, data, and operational focus.

### Infrastructure-first execution

- Rust-first high-frequency trading execution
- In-region and co-located routing
- Deterministic, constraint-driven execution decisions

### Bounded reasoning

Bounded reasoning aims to reduce failure modes that are common in unconstrained automated systems:

- It enforces admissibility rules.
- It produces auditable decision records.
- It limits uncontrolled strategy drift.

### Distribution and composability

- Terminal-first distribution for active traders
- Vaults for passive depositors
- Receipt token design for composability

### Partnerships

- OpenServ for bounded agent infrastructure
- DomeAPI for execution integration

---

## Roadmap
