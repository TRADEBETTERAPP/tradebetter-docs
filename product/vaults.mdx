## What a vault is

BETTER Vaults pool user USD Coin deposits on Base and execute prediction market strategies on your behalf. Vault performance is tracked in the Terminal.

<Note>
  Vaults are launching in stages. Availability depends on staged releases.
</Note>

## How deposits work

1. Meet the `$BETTER` access requirement (hold to view the Terminal; stake the same quantity to deposit)
2. Deposit USD Coin on Base into a BETTER vault
3. Track your position and performance in the Terminal

## Strategy execution

- Signals are generated by the BRAID agent pipeline
- Risk and liquidity checks gate each trade
- Qualified orders execute via the Rust-based high-frequency trading engine

## Mirror vault (receipt tokens)

Receipt tokens (`vBETTER`) add liquidity to vault exposure:

- **Base Vault (Feeder):** holds capital and executes
- **Receipt Vault (Master):** mints/burns `vBETTER` based on performance accounting

## Withdrawals, fees, and settlement

### Fees

- **Twenty per cent performance fee on profits only**, charged on withdrawal.
- **No fee** if USD Coin withdrawn is below entry value (based on average entry per wallet).

Vault performance fees contribute to protocol revenue used for routine `$BETTER` buybacks and burns. See [$BETTER Token](/token/better-token).

### Staking lock

Staked `$BETTER` remains locked until you withdraw all funds from the vault.

<Note>
  Vault mechanics (deposit windows, withdrawals, settlement) are vault-specific. Always verify the current flow and parameters in the app before depositing.
</Note>

## Best practices

- Start with a small deposit to understand the flow
- Monitor performance and exposure regularly
- Review [Risks & Disclaimers](/legal/risks) before allocating capital
