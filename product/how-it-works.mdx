## System flow

BETTER combines data ingestion, signal processing, and low-latency execution into a single pipeline.

<Note>
  BETTER is launching in stages. This page describes the intended production flow; availability depends on staged releases.
</Note>

The system is designed to monitor blockchain mempools and prediction market order books in real time:

- **On-chain transactions:** Wallet movements, contract interactions, insider activity
- **Order book data:** Bids, asks, liquidity depth across Polymarket's CLOB
- **External feeds:** News APIs, social sentiment, event data

For Terminal launch, production routing is co-located in the same data centre facility as the relevant order books.

### 2. Signal processing (BRAID Protocol)

Raw data is processed through the OpenServ AI agents running the BRAID protocol. The system builds a **Reasoning DAG** (Directed Acyclic Graph) that:

- Assigns **Insider Scores** to wallets based on historical accuracy
- Calculates **liquidity depth** to estimate slippage
- Maps **risk correlations** across existing positions
- Generates actionable signals with confidence scores

Signals are processed continuously to generate trade decisions.

### 3. Terminal display

Processed signals flow to the Terminal in real time. Users with access can see:

- Live signal feed with context (wallet scores, liquidity, correlation)
- Which signals the AI agents are acting on
- Copy-trading opportunities for manual execution

### 4. Vault execution

For vault depositors, the execution engine automatically acts on qualified signals:

- Signals pass through logic gates (liquidity check, risk check)
- Qualified trades execute via the Rust-based high-frequency trading engine
- Positions are managed 24/7 without human intervention

## User flow

1. **Deposit (Base):** Users deposit USD Coin into a BETTER vault on Base.
2. **Execute (Prediction Markets):** The pipeline processes signals and executes trades on behalf of vault depositors.
3. **Account (Optional):** A mirrored structure can issue receipt tokens representing vault performance.

## Execution engine

The execution system is built in **Rust** for deterministic performance and low-latency execution.

- **Latency (public claim):** approximately 0.6 milliseconds tick-to-trade, measured from mempool read to transaction hash on Base, then to order finality on Polymarket (Polygon)
- **Co-location:** production routing is co-located in-region for Terminal launch
- **Uptime:** 24/7 execution with automated monitoring

## AI agent stack (BRAID Protocol)

OpenServ AI agents use the BRAID protocol (Bounded Reasoning for Autonomous Inference and Decisions) to process on-chain signals through a Reasoning DAG:

1. **Ingest:** Signal received. Wallet 0x123 (Insider Score 99/100) bought YES on Contract Y.
2. **Liquidity Gate:** Is depth sufficient to enter without \>2% slippage? If NO → ABORT.
3. **Risk Gate:** Does this correlate \>0.8 with existing positions? If YES → ABORT.
4. **Execution:** Fire transaction.

## Mirror vault design

The Mirror Vault separates _where capital lives_ from _where liquidity and composability are best_:

- **Feeder (Real Capital):** The Base vault holds funds and drives trading.
- **Master (Public Receipt):** A Polygon-side vault observes performance and mints an ERC-20 receipt (e.g. `vBETTER`).

## Cross-chain execution

BETTER uses Enclave **MagicSpend++** to coordinate cross-chain execution. Users deposit USD Coin on Base while the system handles bridging and rebalancing as needed.

<Note>
  Cross-chain mechanics can evolve over time; always check the app for current behavior.

## Why receipt tokens matter

Receipt tokens make strategy exposure:

- Easier to transfer
- Tradable 24/7
- Compatible with DeFi primitives (borrowing, LPing, etc.)
