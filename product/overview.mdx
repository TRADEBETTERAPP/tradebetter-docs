## Overview

BETTER gives retail users access to institutional-grade prediction market execution through a vault-based architecture. Deposits are on Base while trades execute through a low-latency stack.

## Who uses BETTER

- **Passive participants:** deposit into Vaults and let the execution engine trade
- **Active participants:** monitor signals and copy-trade in the Terminal

## The Stack

| Component | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| **Vaults** | Deposit USD Coin on Base; capital is deployed across prediction markets |
| **Execution Engine** | Rust-first execution stack with in-region and co-located routing |
| **AI Agents** | OpenServ agents running BRAID for bounded, verifiable decision-making |
| **Terminal** | Real-time feeds, performance dashboards, and copy-trading tools |

## User journeys

### Vault-first (passive)
1. Acquire `$BETTER` and meet the access threshold
2. Deposit USD Coin on Base
3. Track performance in the Terminal

### Terminal-first (active)
1. Meet access requirements
2. Monitor signals and context in real time
3. Copy-trade or execute manually alongside vault activity

## Constraints and dependencies

- **Network:** deposits occur on Base
- **Access:** Terminal access is gated by `$BETTER` holdings; Vault deposits require staking the same quantity
- **Execution venues:** prediction market liquidity and availability can vary

## Why Rust

Python and Node.js are too slow. In high-frequency trading, garbage collection pauses are death.

The Terminal targets approximately 0.6 milliseconds tick-to-trade, measured from mempool read to transaction hash on Base, then to order finality on Polymarket (Polygon).

For Terminal launch, production routing is co-located in the same data centre facility as the relevant prediction market order books.
