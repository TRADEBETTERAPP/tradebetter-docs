## Overview

The Terminal is the interface for active users who want real-time context on vault activity, signals, and execution.

<Note>
  The Terminal is launching in stages. Live copy trading is planned to go live within 48 hours of the token generation event (21 January 2026).
</Note>

## What you can do

- Monitor vault performance and positions
- View live strategy activity and signal context
- Copy-trade positions or execute alongside the vault

## Data surfaces

- **Signal feed:** insider scores, liquidity depth, and correlation context
- **Execution stream:** trades as they execute
- **Vault analytics:** performance, exposure, and historical activity

## Access requirements

Terminal access is gated by holding `$BETTER` on Base. Thresholds vary by fully diluted valuation tier.

Lite Mode (optional) halves the Terminal holding requirement and charges a fee of two per cent of notional volume (in USD Coin terms) traded via the Terminal.

## When to use the Terminal

Use the Terminal if you want to understand **why** trades are made, not just **how** they perform.

<Tip>
  Access thresholds can change—check the app UI for current requirements.
