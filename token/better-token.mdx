## What $BETTER is

`$BETTER` is the access and alignment token for the BETTER ecosystem. It gates product usage and aligns demand with protocol activity.

## Utility

### Access gating

- Hold `$BETTER` to view the Terminal
- Stake the same quantity to deposit into Vaults
- Thresholds vary by fully diluted valuation tier; Lite Mode (optional) halves the Terminal holding requirement

### Alignment

Gating helps reduce edge dilution, align incentives, and tie product usage to the token.

## How $BETTER benefits holders

`$BETTER` is not only an access gate. It is also designed to accrue value through routine buybacks and burns funded by BETTER revenue.

### Buyback and burn programme

BETTER uses revenue from:

- Vault performance fees
- The business-to-business prediction market data ingestion product (sold to prop firms)
- OpenRouter API credits for BETTER's in-house open-source LLM trained exclusively on prediction market data

to routinely buy and burn `$BETTER`.

### Arbitrage buybacks

When the HFT system captures arbitrage between `vBETTER` and the underlying vault exposure, or between vault exposure and `$TRUTH-PERP` on Hyperliquid, **30 per cent of net arbitrage profits** are used to buy and burn `$BETTER`.

### Trading taxes

On buys and sells of `$BETTER`, a **two per cent (2%) buy tax** and **two per cent (2%) sell tax** apply. These taxes route to the protocol treasury and fund capital expenditure such as infrastructure and hosting.

<Tip>
  The Terminal's Lite Mode fee (two per cent of notional volume traded) is separate from the `$BETTER` buy and sell tax.
