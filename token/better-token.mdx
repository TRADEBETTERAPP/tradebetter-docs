## What $BETTER is

`$BETTER` is the access and alignment token for the BETTER ecosystem. It gates product usage and aligns demand with protocol activity.

## Utility

### Access gating

- Hold `$BETTER` to view the Terminal
- Stake the same quantity to deposit into Vaults
- Thresholds vary by fully diluted valuation tier; Lite Mode (optional) halves the Terminal holding requirement

### Alignment

Gating helps reduce edge dilution, align incentives, and tie product usage to the token.
