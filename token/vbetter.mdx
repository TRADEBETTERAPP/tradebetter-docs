## What vBETTER is

`vBETTER` is a **receipt token**—a standard ERC-20 that represents a share of a BETTER vault's performance.

## Why receipt tokens exist

Traditional vault deposits are "stuck." They're hard to transfer, hard to exit quickly, and incompatible with broader DeFi.

## What vBETTER enables

Receipt tokens make strategy exposure:

- **Transferable:** Move your vault position to another wallet
- **Tradable:** 24/7 liquidity on secondary markets
- **Composable:** Use as collateral for borrowing, add to LPs, integrate with DeFi primitives

## How it works

In the Mirror Vault design, the Enzyme vault framework acts as the on-chain accountant:

1. **Observe:** Track the vault's assets and performance
2. **Mint:** Issue `vBETTER` tokens based on verified accounting
3. **Redeem:** Burn tokens to withdraw proportional share

## Mirror vault architecture

- **Base Vault (Feeder):** Holds real capital, executes trades
- **Polygon Vault (Master):** Observes performance, mints/burns receipt tokens

This separates where capital lives from where liquidity is best.

## Arbitrage flywheel

`vBETTER` creates a liquid market against vault shares. Pricing gaps between the Base feeder vault and `vBETTER` are captured through mint and burn mechanics.

When `vBETTER` trades at a premium, the protocol can mint and sell `vBETTER` to capture the spread, then use proceeds to buy and burn `$BETTER`.

## Availability

Receipt token support rolls out per vault. The app shows current availability.

<Note>
  Receipt token mechanics (mint/redemption, pricing, safeguards) are protocol-specific and evolve with protocol updates.
