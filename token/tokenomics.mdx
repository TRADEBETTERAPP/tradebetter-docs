## Circulating Supply

Initial circulating supply: approximately **400,000,000 (40 per cent)**.

For this document, “circulating” refers to the public sale allocation plus the liquidity allocation.

## Access gate (hold and stake)

The access gate keeps USD access stable as fully diluted valuation rises, rewards early holders, and preserves execution quality by limiting congestion.

- Hold `$BETTER` to view the Terminal.
- Stake the same quantity to deposit into Vaults.

Staked `$BETTER` remains locked until you withdraw all funds from the vault.

### Gate phases

- **Phase one (below US$10 million fully diluted valuation):** 100,000 `$BETTER`
  - At US$0.005 (US$5 million market capitalisation): approximately US$500
  - At US$0.01 (US$10 million market capitalisation): approximately US$1,000
- **Phase two (US$10 million–US$20 million fully diluted valuation):** 75,000 `$BETTER`
  - At US$0.02 (US$20 million market capitalisation): approximately US$1,500
- **Phase three (US$20 million–US$40 million fully diluted valuation):** 50,000 `$BETTER`
  - At US$0.04 (US$40 million market capitalisation): approximately US$2,000
- **Phase four (US$100 million or more fully diluted valuation):** 10,000 `$BETTER`
  - At US$0.10 (US$100 million market capitalisation): approximately US$1,000

### Lite Mode

Lite Mode is an optional execution path enabled at log-in.

- When enabled, the Terminal holding requirement halves.
- Vault access requirements remain unchanged.
- A fee of **two per cent of notional volume (in USD Coin terms)** is charged on volume traded via the Terminal.

| Phase | Terminal (hold) | Terminal (hold) with Lite Mode | Vaults (stake) |
| ----: | --------------: | -----------------------------: | -------------: |
| 1     | 100,000         | 50,000                         | 100,000        |
| 2     | 75,000          | 37,500                         | 75,000         |

## Programmatic Funding

Programmatic funding is operational and will be used to fund model credits as well as infrastructure and physical hardware.
