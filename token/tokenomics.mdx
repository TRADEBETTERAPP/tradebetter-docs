## Supply

- **Total supply:** 1,000,000,000
- **Ticker:** `$BETTER`
- **Network:** Base

## Allocation

| Allocation                      | Per cent |      Amount | Vesting / lock-up                                                                       |
| ------------------------------ | ------: | ----------: | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Public sale + liquidity (Base BETTER/WETH) | 40% | 400,000,000 | Public sale unlocked at the token generation event; liquidity deployed to the Base BETTER/WETH pool with liquidity provider tokens locked permanently |
| Team                           |     20% | 200,000,000 | 15-month vesting with a six-month cliff, then nine-month linear unlock                  |
| Treasury                       |     25% | 250,000,000 | 12-month linear unlock from the token generation event                                  |
| OpenServ SERV token drop       |      5% |  50,000,000 | Unlocked (claimed by SERV token stakers via tasks)                                      |
| Programmatic funding           |     10% | 100,000,000 | Released across fully diluted valuation bands                                           |

The liquidity portion is deployed to the initial **BETTER/WETH** pool on **Base**; liquidity provider tokens are locked.

## Circulating Supply

Initial circulating supply: approximately **400,000,000 (40 per cent)**.

For this document, “circulating” refers to the combined public sale plus liquidity allocation.

## Access gate (hold and stake)

The access gate is denominated in tokens, but designed to keep the **estimated USD cost** of access roughly stable as fully diluted valuation rises.

As fully diluted valuation rises, the required `$BETTER` threshold **ratchets down**. This preserves execution quality by limiting congestion while keeping access costs comparatively stable.

This “rewards early holders” in a simple way: if you bought enough `$BETTER` to meet an earlier (higher) threshold, you may be able to reduce your token exposure later (by selling down to the new lower requirement) while retaining access.

- Hold `$BETTER` to view the Terminal.
- Stake the same quantity to deposit into Vaults.

Staked `$BETTER` remains locked until you withdraw all funds from the vault.

### Gate phases

| Phase | Fully diluted valuation band | Gate (hold) |
| ----: | ---------------------------- | ----------: |
| 1     | Below US\$10 million          | 100,000     |
| 2     | US\$10 million–US\$20 million  | 75,000      |
| 3     | US\$20 million–US\$40 million  | 50,000      |
| 4     | US\$100 million or more       | 10,000      |

Between US\$40 million and US\$100 million, the phase three threshold continues to apply.

Illustrative access cost examples:

- Phase one: approximately US\$500 at US\$0.005 (US\$5 million market capitalisation); approximately US\$1,000 at US\$0.01 (US\$10 million market capitalisation).
- Phase two: approximately US\$1,500 at US\$0.02 (US\$20 million market capitalisation).
- Phase three: approximately US\$2,000 at US\$0.04 (US\$40 million market capitalisation).
- Phase four: approximately US\$1,000 at US\$0.10 (US\$100 million market capitalisation).

<Tip>
  **Worked example (illustrative):** if you acquired **100,000** `$BETTER` at **US\$0.005** (approximately **US\$500**) and later the gate moves to phase two (**75,000**), you can sell **25,000** `$BETTER` and still retain access.
</Tip>

### Lite Mode

Lite Mode is an optional execution path enabled at log-in.

- When enabled, the Terminal holding requirement halves.
- Vault access requirements remain unchanged.
- A fee of **two per cent of notional volume (in USD Coin terms)** is charged on volume traded via the Terminal.

| Phase | Terminal (hold) | Terminal (hold) with Lite Mode | Vaults (stake) |
| ----: | --------------: | -----------------------------: | -------------: |
| 1     | 100,000         | 50,000                         | 100,000        |
| 2     | 75,000          | 37,500                         | 75,000         |
| 3     | 50,000          | 25,000                         | 50,000         |
| 4     | 10,000          | 5,000                          | 10,000         |

## Value accrual and buybacks

`$BETTER` is designed to accrue value through routine buybacks and burns funded by BETTER revenue.

| Source | Mechanism | Buy and burn policy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Vault fees | Twenty per cent performance fee on profits only, charged on withdrawal | Treasury-funded routine buybacks and burns |
| Business-to-business ingestion product | Sale of prediction market data ingestion infrastructure to prop firms | Treasury-funded routine buybacks and burns |
| OpenRouter API credits | API credits sold for BETTER's in-house open-source LLM trained exclusively on prediction market data | Treasury-funded routine buybacks and burns |
| vBETTER arbitrage | Capture pricing gaps between `vBETTER` and underlying vault exposure | 30 per cent of net arbitrage profits are used to buy and burn `$BETTER` |
| `$TRUTH-PERP` arbitrage | Capture pricing gaps between vault exposure and `$TRUTH-PERP` on Hyperliquid | 30 per cent of net arbitrage profits are used to buy and burn `$BETTER` |

<Note>
  Buyback and burn routing and cadence can evolve. The app and on-chain data remain the source of truth.
</Note>

## Trading taxes

On buys and sells of `$BETTER`, a **two per cent (2%) buy tax** and **two per cent (2%) sell tax** apply. These taxes route to the protocol treasury and fund capital expenditure such as infrastructure and hosting.

<Tip>
  This tax is separate from the Terminal's Lite Mode fee (two per cent of notional volume traded).
</Tip>

## Programmatic Funding

Programmatic funding is operational and will be used to fund OpenRouter API credits for BETTER's in-house open-source LLM (trained exclusively on prediction market data), as well as infrastructure and physical hardware.

| Fully diluted valuation range | Sold      | Raise       | Cumulative  |
| :--------------------------- | --------: | ----------: | ----------: |
| US\$1 million–US\$5 million    | 2 per cent | US\$60,000    | US\$60,000    |
| US\$5 million–US\$10 million   | 2 per cent | US\$150,000   | US\$210,000   |
| US\$10 million–US\$20 million  | 2 per cent | US\$300,000   | US\$510,000   |
| US\$20 million–US\$50 million  | 2 per cent | US\$700,000   | US\$1,210,000 |
| US\$50 million–US\$100 million | 2 per cent | US\$1,500,000 | US\$2,710,000 |
