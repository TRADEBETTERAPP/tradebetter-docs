## Supply

- **Total supply:** 1,000,000,000
- **Ticker:** `$BETTER`
- **Network:** Base

## Allocation

| Allocation                      | Per cent |      Amount | Vesting / lock-up                                                                       |
| ------------------------------ | ------: | ----------: | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Public sale (launchpad)        |     25% | 250,000,000 | Unlocked at the token generation event                                                  |
| Liquidity (Base BETTER/ETH)    |     15% | 150,000,000 | Locked permanently (liquidity provider tokens locked)                                   |
| Team                           |     20% | 200,000,000 | 15-month vesting with a six-month cliff, then nine-month linear unlock                  |
| Treasury                       |     25% | 250,000,000 | 12-month linear unlock from the token generation event                                  |
| OpenServ SERV token drop       |      5% |  50,000,000 | Unlocked (claimed by SERV token stakers via tasks)                                      |
| Programmatic funding           |     10% | 100,000,000 | Released across fully diluted valuation bands                                           |

Liquidity refers to the initial **BETTER/ETH** pool on **Base**; liquidity provider tokens are locked.

## Circulating Supply

Initial circulating supply: approximately **400,000,000 (40 per cent)**.

For this document, “circulating” refers to the public sale allocation plus the liquidity allocation.

## Access gate (hold and stake)

The access gate is denominated in tokens, but designed to keep the **estimated USD cost** of access roughly stable as fully diluted valuation rises.

As fully diluted valuation rises, the required `$BETTER` threshold **ratchets down**. This preserves execution quality by limiting congestion while keeping access costs comparatively stable.

This “rewards early holders” in a simple way: if you bought enough `$BETTER` to meet an earlier (higher) threshold, you may be able to reduce your token exposure later (by selling down to the new lower requirement) while retaining access.

- Hold `$BETTER` to view the Terminal.
- Stake the same quantity to deposit into Vaults.

Staked `$BETTER` remains locked until you withdraw all funds from the vault.

### Gate phases

| Phase | Fully diluted valuation band | Gate (hold) |
| ----: | ---------------------------- | ----------: |
| 1     | Below US$10 million          | 100,000     |
| 2     | US$10 million–US$20 million  | 75,000      |
| 3     | US$20 million–US$40 million  | 50,000      |
| 4     | US$100 million or more       | 10,000      |

Between US$40 million and US$100 million, the phase three threshold continues to apply.

Illustrative access cost examples:

- Phase one: approximately US$500 at US$0.005 (US$5 million market capitalisation); approximately US$1,000 at US$0.01 (US$10 million market capitalisation).
- Phase two: approximately US$1,500 at US$0.02 (US$20 million market capitalisation).
- Phase three: approximately US$2,000 at US$0.04 (US$40 million market capitalisation).
- Phase four: approximately US$1,000 at US$0.10 (US$100 million market capitalisation).

<Tip>
  **Worked example (illustrative):** if you acquired **100,000** `$BETTER` at **US$0.005** (approximately **US$500**) and later the gate moves to phase two (**75,000**), you can sell **25,000** `$BETTER` and still retain access.

### Lite Mode

Lite Mode is an optional execution path enabled at log-in.

- When enabled, the Terminal holding requirement halves.
- Vault access requirements remain unchanged.
- A fee of **two per cent of notional volume (in USD Coin terms)** is charged on volume traded via the Terminal.

| Phase | Terminal (hold) | Terminal (hold) with Lite Mode | Vaults (stake) |
| ----: | --------------: | -----------------------------: | -------------: |
| 1     | 100,000         | 50,000                         | 100,000        |
| 2     | 75,000          | 37,500                         | 75,000         |
| 3     | 50,000          | 25,000                         | 50,000         |
| 4     | 10,000          | 5,000                          | 10,000         |

## Programmatic Funding

Programmatic funding is operational and will be used to fund OpenRouter API credits for BETTER's in-house open-source LLM (trained exclusively on prediction market data), as well as infrastructure and physical hardware.

| Fully diluted valuation range | Sold      | Raise       | Cumulative  |
| :--------------------------- | --------: | ----------: | ----------: |
| US$1 million–US$5 million    | 2 per cent | US$60,000    | US$60,000    |
| US$5 million–US$10 million   | 2 per cent | US$150,000   | US$210,000   |
| US$10 million–US$20 million  | 2 per cent | US$300,000   | US$510,000   |
| US$20 million–US$50 million  | 2 per cent | US$700,000   | US$1,210,000 |
| US$50 million–US$100 million | 2 per cent | US$1,500,000 | US$2,710,000 |
