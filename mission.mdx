## The shift

Prediction markets settle on objective outcomes, but **execution fairness** is still determined by speed. Retail users often arrive after price moves.

## The problem

When news breaks, low-latency systems react first. That creates a structural disadvantage for users trading manually.

## Our mission

BETTER exists to **democratize speed** in prediction markets by turning execution infrastructure into a shared public good.

## Principles

- **Fairer access:** pool capital so retail users can benefit from professional execution
- **Transparent mechanics:** surface signals, context, and performance in the Terminal
- **Composable outcomes:** enable receipt tokens (`vBETTER`) to make strategy exposure transferable

## How we deliver

- **Vault-based access** on Base for institutional-grade execution
- **Agentic automation** via OpenServ AI running the BRAID protocol
- **Cross-chain abstraction** to reduce friction for users
