## Getting Started

<Info>
  **Prerequisites**
  - A wallet with USD Coin on **Base**
  - Ability to sign transactions from the deposit wallet
  - `$BETTER` holdings that meet the current access threshold
</Info>

<Note>
  BETTER is launching in stages. The Terminal (with live copy trading) goes live within 48 hours of the token generation event (21 January 2026). Access thresholds and mechanics can change. Verify the current requirements in the app.
</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prepare your wallet">
    - Bridge or acquire **USD Coin on Base**
    - Ensure you can sign transactions from your deposit wallet
  </Step>

  <Step title="Meet the access requirement">
    Terminal access is gated by holding `$BETTER` on Base. Vault access requires staking the same quantity.

    Buying and selling `$BETTER` includes a two per cent (2%) buy tax and two per cent (2%) sell tax routed to the protocol treasury. See [Tokenomics](/token/tokenomics).

    Check the **current threshold** in the app and see [Token details](/token/better-token).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use the Terminal">
    When access is enabled, use the Terminal to:

    - Monitor signals and context
    - Copy-trade within the Terminal
    - Track vault performance when Vaults are enabled
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deposit into a vault">
    When Vaults are enabled for your account, deposit USD Coin into a BETTER vault on Base. Once deposited, the execution engine trades on your behalf using:

    - Rust-based high-frequency trading execution
    - AI agents processing large-scale on-chain signals
    - 24/7 strategy execution across prediction markets
  </Step>

  <Step title="Track performance">
    Use the Terminal to monitor:
    - Vault performance and positions
    - Real-time high-frequency trading feed and signal context
    - Copy-trading opportunities
  </Step>

  <Step title="Withdraw when ready">
    Withdrawals depend on vault mechanics and settlement. Confirm the current withdrawal flow in the app.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Verify

- When Vaults are enabled, your wallet shows an active deposit
- The Terminal reflects your position and performance
