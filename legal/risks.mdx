## Not financial advice

Nothing in these docs is investment, legal, or tax advice. You are responsible for your own decisions.

## Key risks

- **Smart contract risk:** vaults, tokens, and integrations can contain bugs or vulnerabilities.
- **Market risk:** prediction markets can be volatile; positions can move against you.
- **Liquidity risk:** thin order books can increase slippage and make exits costly.
- **Execution/latency risk:** fast markets can move before orders land; strategy performance can change.
- **Oracle/settlement risk:** outcome resolution can be delayed or disputed depending on the oracle process.
- **Cross-chain/integration risk:** bridges and cross-chain spend abstractions can fail or behave unexpectedly.
- **Regulatory risk:** prediction markets and tokenized products can face changing legal/regulatory constraints.
