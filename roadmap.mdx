## Phase 1 (Q1 2026): Tokenize the Vault to solve access

Pain: “I want alpha but lack time/skill.”

- Token-gated Terminal + stake-to-enable vault deposits; expand signal sourcing via Kalshi/Opinion builder programs.
- Ratchet gate as fully diluted valuation rises (100,000 → 75,000 → 50,000 → 10,000 `$BETTER`) to keep access stable and reward early holders.
- Vault execution powered by OpenServ BRAID-bounded agents + Rust high-frequency trading rails.
- Enclave chain abstraction: gasless deposits from any asset into Base.

## Phase 2 (Q2 2026): Arbitrage Flywheel to solve liquidity

Pain: “I need to exit without penalty.”

- vBETTER: a liquid receipt token for vault shares (Enzyme vault shares).
- LP incentives on Aerodrome/Uniswap; secondary yield for depositors.
- When vBETTER trades at a premium, mint/sell to capture spread → buy/burn \$BETTER.

## Phase 3 (Q4 2026): The End Game to solve leverage

Pain: “Spot prediction markets are binary; I want leverage or hedging.”

- `$TRUTH-PERP` on Hyperliquid via HIP-3: an index for exposure across prediction markets (“Nasdaq of Truth”).
- HIP-3 barrier: stake 500,000 HYPE (~\$11M), creating a moat against copycats.
- Arb between vault AUM + `$TRUTH-PERP` → buy/burn \$BETTER.

## The Opportunity

The prediction market sector is converging three massive verticals:

| Vertical                | Market Size |
| ----------------------- | ----------- |
| Gambling/Sports Betting | \$200B+     |
| Financial Derivatives   | \$850T+ OTC |
| News/Information        | Emerging    |

When BETTER captures 1% of this flow, the value accrual is staggering.
