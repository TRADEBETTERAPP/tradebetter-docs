## Core Concepts

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Prediction Market** | A market where contracts settle based on real-world outcomes (e.g. election results, sports scores, economic data). |
| **Polymarket** | The leading prediction market venue, operating on Polygon. |
| **Kalshi** | US regulatory-approved prediction market platform. |
| **Opinion.xyz** | Emerging prediction market protocol. |
| **CLOB** | Central Limit Order Book—a market structure with bids, asks, and matching. |
| **Alpha Decay** | The rapid erosion of trading edge once information becomes widely known and priced in; in prediction markets, this can occur within milliseconds. |
| **PvP** | Player vs Player—the Casino Era dynamic where profit comes at the expense of other participants. |

## BETTER Architecture

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Mempool Ingestion** | The first stage of the pipeline—monitoring blockchain mempools and order books for real-time on-chain activity. |
| **Signal Processing** | The second stage—raw data is processed by AI agents to generate actionable trading signals with confidence scores. |
| **Vault** | A pooled USD Coin deposit product on Base (staged rollout). For depositors, strategies execute on their behalf and performance is tracked in the Terminal. |
| **Terminal** | Product interface for real-time high-frequency trading feeds, performance dashboards, and copy-trading. Displays processed signals. |
| **Execution Engine** | Rust-first execution stack with in-region and co-located routing. Public tick-to-trade claim: approximately 0.6 milliseconds, measured from mempool read to transaction hash on Base, then to order finality on Polymarket (Polygon). |
| **BRAID Protocol** | Bounded Reasoning for Autonomous Inference and Decisions—the constrained decision framework used by OpenServ agents. Trades must pass explicit checks (for example: liquidity depth, slippage, correlation, and risk limits) before execution. |
| **Reasoning DAG** | Directed Acyclic Graph used by AI agents to verify liquidity, risk correlation, and insider signals before execution. |
| **MagicSpend++** | Enclave's cross-chain spending abstraction enabling zero-friction deposits and execution. |
| **Mirror Vault** | Architecture with a "feeder" vault (Base, real capital) and "master" vault (Polygon, receipt tokens). |
| **Co-location** | Placing servers in the same data centers as exchange infrastructure for minimum latency. |
| **Ratchet gate** | A token-denominated access threshold that decreases as fully diluted valuation rises, designed to keep the estimated USD cost of access comparatively stable across phases. |
| **FDV** | Fully diluted valuation—the market capitalisation implied by the token price multiplied by the total token supply. |

## Tokens

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **$BETTER** | The protocol token that gates Terminal access (hold) and Vault access (stake). Thresholds vary by fully diluted valuation tier and optional Lite Mode. |
| **vBETTER** | ERC-20 receipt token representing a share of vault performance. |
| **$SERV** | OpenServ protocol token; $BETTER holders may receive airdrops. |

## Market Mechanics

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Premium/Discount** | When a token trades above/below its implied underlying value. |
| **Arbitrage** | Capturing spreads by buying low in one venue and selling high in another. |
| **HFT** | High-Frequency Trading—algorithmic trading measured in milliseconds or microseconds. |
| **Insider Score** | BETTER's proprietary metric rating the historical accuracy of specific wallet addresses. |
| **HIP-3** | Growth Protocol mechanism for launching professional-grade synthetic markets. |
